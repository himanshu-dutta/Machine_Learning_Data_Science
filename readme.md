# Machine Learning and Data Science
 In this course, we'll be going through the following topics, divided in the form of modules. There are a total of ten modules which require you to have a basic knowledge of coding in any language, and some knowledge of high school mathematics, like Linear Algebra, elementary Statistics and Differential Calculus. Even if you don't, we will cover most of it as we go along the course.
